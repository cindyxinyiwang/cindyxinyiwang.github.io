I am a research scientist at Google DeepMind working on natural language processing and large language models. My work focuses on developing robust and reliable LLMs. 

Before joining Google, I received a PhD degree from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University working with <a href='https://www.phontron.com/'>Graham Neubig</a>. Before that, I did my undergrad at University of Notre Dame in Computer Science and Economics, where I worked with <a href='https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/'>David Chiang</a> on Natural Language Processing.
